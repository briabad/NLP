## RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORKS 

### WHAT IS IT A RNN?
Recurrent neural networks (RNN) are a class of neural networks that is powerful for modeling sequence data such as time series or natural language. This kind of neural network is made up with cells that take the output of the previous cell as input. 
 
Recurrent neural networks can be used for a number of sequence-based problems:

- **One to one**: one input, one output, such as image classification.
- **One to many**: one input, many outputs, such as image captioning (image input, a sequence of text as caption output).
- **Many to one**: many inputs, one outputs, such as text classification (classifying a Tweet as real diaster or not real diaster).
- **Many to many**: many inputs, many outputs, such as machine translation (translating English to Spanish) or speech to text (audio wave as input, text as output).

When you come across RNN's, you'll most likely come across variants of the following:

- **Long short-term memory cells** (LSTMs).
- **Gated recurrent units** (GRUs).
- **Bidirectional RNN's** (passes forward and backward along a sequence, left to right and right to left).

## NLP 


This are the different problems that NLP can resolve:
- Machine Translation (e.g. Translate Chinese text to English)
- Semantic Analysis (What is the meaning of query statement?)
- Coreference (e.g. What does "he" or "it" refer to given a document?)
- Question Answering (e.g. Answering Jeopardy questions).
